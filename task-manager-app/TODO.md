# Task Manager Statistics & Dashboard Implementation - TODO

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Codebase Analysis
- [x] Analyzed current Task model structure (task-manager-app/server/models/Task.js)
- [x] Examined existing task routes (task-manager-app/server/routes/tasks.js)
- [x] Reviewed current Dashboard implementation (task-manager-app/client/src/pages/Dashboard.js)
- [x] Understood server architecture and routing setup

### 2. Statistics API Endpoints
- [x] Created `/api/statistics/basic` endpoint for basic task metrics
  - Total tasks, completed tasks, pending tasks, in-progress tasks
  - Overdue tasks calculation
  - Completion rate percentage
  - Tasks by priority (high/medium/low)
  - Tasks by status distribution
- [x] Created `/api/statistics/productivity` endpoint for productivity metrics
  - Completion trends over time (week/month/year)
  - Tasks created vs completed comparison
  - Average tasks per day calculation
  - Configurable time periods
- [x] Created `/api/statistics/recent-activity` endpoint
  - Recently completed tasks with metadata
  - Configurable limit parameter
- [x] Created `/api/statistics/due-soon` endpoint
  - Tasks due within next N days (default 7)
  - Includes priority and status information
- [x] Added statistics routes to server.js

### 3. Dashboard Widgets & Visual Components
- [x] Created Statistics component with visual representations
- [x] Implemented summary cards showing:
  - Task completion rate (percentage)
  - Total tasks count
  - Overdue tasks count
  - Average tasks per day
- [x] Added visual charts:
  - Tasks by status (pie chart)
  - Tasks by priority (pie chart)
  - Productivity trends (line chart - created vs completed)
- [x] Added activity widgets:
  - Recent activity/completed tasks list
  - Due soon tasks list with priority indicators

### 4. Integration & UI/UX
- [x] Updated Dashboard.js with tab navigation
- [x] Added "Tasks & Categories" and "Statistics & Analytics" tabs
- [x] Integrated Statistics component into Dashboard
- [x] Added comprehensive CSS styling for all components
- [x] Implemented responsive design for mobile devices
- [x] Added period selector for productivity metrics (week/month/year)
- [x] Added loading states and error handling

### 5. Dependencies & Setup
- [x] Installed Chart.js and react-chartjs-2 for visualizations
- [x] Registered all necessary Chart.js components
- [x] Added proper error handling and loading states
